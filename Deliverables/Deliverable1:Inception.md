# Project Inception
## 1. Introduction: describe in one paragraph what your project is about. Make it clear what problem your software is solving and the context of the solution.
Our project is addressing the issue that is our current LOUIE website. We are creating an extension that allows users to make informed decisions when enrolling for classes and streamlines the enrollment process. Louie does not allow you to view your academic advisement report and current offered classes at the same time, so we plan to address that. We also want to gather information from Rate My Professor, so students can understand what each instructor is rated and previous semester’s class data without leaving LOUIE. Our goal is to have LOUIE become optimized with this extension and have students know exactly what they are getting into when they enroll into a course.
Initial value proposition and customer segments: report the initial guesses for the (i) value proposition and (ii) customer segment. The value proposition should make clear what your product is, the target customer, the value you provide, and why your product is unique. See examples on the lecture slides.
IVP: 
For students who want more informative decision-making while enrolling for classes in LOUIE, our browser extension provides unique statistical information about the classes and professors, so you can spend more time choosing, not guessing. 
## 2. Interviews Summary: 
### Interview 1:
Who was Interviewed: A film student named Eric Lessing
When: 9/15/23 at 8:00am
Customer segment: Any NAU Student
Key insights from the interview:
LOUIE has a stressful and not very intuitive design
LOUIE should include what requirements the classes are fulfilling on enrollment page
LOUIE needs a better way to show information about classes
Representative quotes:
“I have to use multiple tabs to get the information I need”
“It needs to combine the elements of the NAU course catalog with your graduation plan.”
“It needs to show what classes you still need to take, and include useful information on what the classes are about.”
Assessment: Nice To Have 

### Interview 2: 
Who was Interviewed: An electrical engineer named Kale
When: 9/15/23 at 11:30ish am
Customer segment: Any NAU Student 
Key insights from the interview: 
While LOUIE is not exactly frustrating to them, there is a lot more to be desired
Signing up for classes is generally an underwhelming experience, missing important information such as class pass/fail rate statistics, or professor ratings.
He stressed for major specific classes, being able to know your professor beforehand is helpful
Representative quotes: 
“The overall design of LOUIE is super outdated, a browser extension to bring some modern features would be helpful”
“Having more information about who your major specific professors are, is really important to me” 
Assessment: Nice to have.

### Interview 4:
Who was Interviewed: A Computer Science student named Zach
When: 9/14/23 at 12:50pm
Customer segment: Any NAU Student
Key insights from the interview:
Zach does not show any real interest in this extension
He prefers to schedule an appointment with the registration office for assistance

Representative quotes:
“I'm not really interested”
Assessment: Don’t care

###Interview 5
Who was interviewed: Student named Alonso
When: Thursday, September 14th 2023
Customer Segment: NAU Student
Key insights from the interview:

“I will just adapt to [a professor’s] class.”
“I always need to check the progression plan”
Assessment: Nice To Have 
### Interview 6:
Who was Interviewed: A computer Science Student named Zachary Hallemeyer
When: 9/14/23 at 6:00pm
Customer segment: Any NAU Student


Key insights from the interview:
LOUIE is bloated and has a subpar interface.
He wants to be able to see what he is signing up for while enrolling
He finds the lack of information concerning
Representative quotes:
“Yes, it feels bloated and has a subpar user interface.”
“Specifically when the professor is not listed, as I have had classes canceled when there is no professor.”
“That would be very helpful.”(in reference to the proposed extension)
Assessment: Nice To Have 
Final value proposition and consumer segments: report the refined versions of these elements (the ones that you reached after the interviews). 
Final IVP: For students who want more informative decision-making while enrolling for classes in LOUIE, our browser extension provides unique statistical information about the classes, professors, and status requirements, so you can spend more time choosing, not guessing.
