**Deliverable 3: Requirements**

1\. **System Description**

The enrollment process at **Northern Arizona University** is a frustrating experience because of **_LOUIE's_** suboptimal user interface. For **NAU students**, the process for **_enrolling_** in a **course** can be a shot in the dark, and the challenges encountered from making uninformed decisions when **_enrolling_** can be easily avoided. **Pinecone** is a web application designed to transform this experience. **Pinecone** is here to inform **_NAU students_** and have a more efficient and user-friendly approach to **class enrollment**. Unlike **_LOUIE’s_** **_default system_**, **Pinecone** is intuitively made to **_simplify_** and **_expedite_** the **enrollment process**, allowing **_students_** to make well-informed decisions, ultimately helping them avoid unnecessary hardships throughout the _term_. With **Pinecone**, **NAU students** can reclaim their time and embrace a smoother, more productive academic journey.&#x20; 

Our web-based scheduling system, known as **Project Pinecone**, allocates itself as a functional and easy solution for **scheduling** needs at **Northern Arizona University**. **Pinecone** caters to **students**_,_ **professors**_,_ **advisors**_,_ and **_administrative staff_**, providing a platform for **_creating_**, **_modifying_**, and **_accessing_** **schedules** promptly. Whether it’s a fellow **NAU student** managing their **class schedule**, **professors** coordinating one-on-one with **students**, or **advisors** assisting with **schedule building** and **management**, **Pinecone** provides a universal platform for everyone’s **scheduling** workflow and being more informed on their daily time management.

**Pinecone** is a massive step towards improving the **scheduling process** at **NAU**, offering a solution that is intuitive for **students, professors, advisors**_,_ and **administrators**, catering to their individual needs. **Pinecone** is committed to aligning with the university’s policies and compliance requirements to ensure security and stability. For **students** who must **_enroll_** in new **classes**, it informs them about the **professor** they will be having and **_shares_** with them the **class distribution data** from the previous **_term_**, so they can see how other students fared. The application also lets them know what **requirements** each **class** fulfills in their **degree program**. For convenience, it automatically creates a **schedule**, so they can see a visual guide to their upcoming **term**, and it can inform them of **scheduling conflicts**, which are not shown in **_LOUIE_** until you **_hit enroll_**.

2\. **Model**

Provide the conceptual model of your system as a UML class diagram. Represent proper cardinalities (multiplicities) for all associations. Also include the association names.
