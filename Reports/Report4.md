Group 6: Louie Extension
Date and location: 09/28/2023, Discord
Present participants: Aaron (Manager), Daniel Minichetti (quality assurance), Sergio Rabadan (Minute Taker)<br> 
Missing participants: TJ Rhode<br> 
Project repo: https://github.com/UnlimitedDrip/ProjectPinecone
## **1. Summary of activities**
Each member reports on their activities since the last meeting. Remember that coding activity is expected every week.<br>  
**Aaron:** Drew out some sketches for the extension's main features display. Designed overlay instead of separate tab approach for displaying information.<br> 
**Sergio:** Created some designs, sticking to Louie’s color for the window. Came up with some possible designs for other tabs if necessary. Left some space for improvement in case we want to add something extra<br> 
**Daniel:** Went to Microsoft paint and drew some basic designs of the UI for the actual extension window itself. I applied the concepts of what our minimal viable product is and applied that to the design. The current goal is functionality, but user-friendliness is a priority. <br> 
**TJ:** N/A<br> 
## **2. Project retrospective**
In each meeting, you should spend a few minutes discussing how the group is functioning. What aspects of the group dynamics contribute to the success of the project? In addition, raise any issues—best done directly but with humor and kindness—that you believe are interfering with the effectiveness of the group and your ability to complete the project on time.
The project retrospective is an opportunity for the group and each individual to reflect on their experience with the project and improve the way the group works together. Make at least five lists:
**Appreciations:**<br> 
Aaron 
Flexible scheduling for weekly meetings<br> 
**Successes:**<br> 
Good effort and research towards UI design
Developed good use cases and product statements to guide our development<br> 
**Failures:** (what did not go well)<br> 
Missing one team member
Lack of understanding on certain directions in Deliverable 2<br> 
**Barriers:** <br> 
Navigating and still getting the hang of github tools (cringe)
Other Class coursework & work<br> 
**What we should try next time: ** <br> 
N/A<br> 

## **3. Next steps**<br> 
Think about what needs to be done and assign tasks. Update your activity tracker with new tasks, actual hours spent in the activities, corresponding GitHub issues, and the status of the work.<br> 
**Things that need to be done:**<br> 
- Start creating a prototype of the extension<br> 
- Start developing and uploading framework code to GitHub<br> 
- Get feedback from professor<br>
