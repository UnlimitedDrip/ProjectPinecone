# **Report for Week 3 Meeting**
**Group 6:** Project Pine cone<br>
**Date and location:** 9/22/23, Discord<br>
**Present participants:** Aaron (Minute Taker), Daniel Minichetti (Manager), Sergio Rabadan (Presenter), TJ Rhode (Quality assurance)<br>
**Missing participants:** N/A<br>
**Project repo: https:**//github.com/UnlimitedDrip/ProjectPinecone<br>
## **1. Summary of activities**
Each member reports on their activities since the last meeting. Remember that coding activity is expected every week. <br>
**Aaron:** I created a list of the features we would like to have for the extension and separated them into Main and Side Features.<br>
**Sergio:** Designed the Logo for the extension and began to consider some features that might be necessary for the project.<br>
**Daniel:** I started work on some basic UI design. I first drafted up how I wanted the interface to look in Paint, and then I created a very early prototype by programming a browser extension in Firefox using HTML, JS, and CSS. My goal was to just get an idea of how the layout would look in a browser window and what size the buttons should look like. I wanted to have a tab for each feature in the extension, one for professor ratings, class data, and a main page. <br>
**TJ:** I’ll have UML diagram(s) done by tonight<br>
## **2. Project retrospective**
In each meeting, you should spend a few minutes discussing how the group is functioning. What aspects of the group dynamics contribute to the success of the project? In addition, raise any issues—best done directly but with humor and kindness—that you believe are interfering with the effectiveness of the group and your ability to complete the project on time.<br>
The project retrospective is an opportunity for the group and each individual to reflect on their experience with the project and improve the way the group works together. Make at least five lists:<br>
