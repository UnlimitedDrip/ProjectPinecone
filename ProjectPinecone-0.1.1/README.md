# [Project Pinecone](https://github.com/UnlimitedDrip/ProjectPinecone/)

Our system is called Pinecone, and it is a web application that will be useful for students when enrolling in classes at the university. Pinecone is an application that is used to inform NAU students and have a more efficient and user-friendly approach to class enrollment. In an attempt to improve upon LOUIE, Pinecone has a focus on simplifying and expediting the enrollment research process, allowing students to make well-informed decisions, and ultimately helping them avoid unnecessary hardships and confusion throughout the semester. It will accomplish this by displaying professor ratings for each course in addition to class distribution data, so they can see how previous students performed in the class. It also allows students to see which courses fulfill their graduation requirements and automatically creates a calendar file for students to export into a calendar of their choosing.
