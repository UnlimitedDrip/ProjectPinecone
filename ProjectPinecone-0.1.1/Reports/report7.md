Missing participants: N/A\
Project repo: <https://github.com/UnlimitedDrip/ProjectPinecone>


### **1. Summary of activities**

Aaron - I started familiarizing myself with Django and I collected more data to add to the shared Google Drive for us to upload to MySQL.

Daniel - Looked up some basic overviews of react.js since it’s entirely new to me and how it works in tandem with other frontend languages.

Sergio - Attempted to create a database on MySQL, will reattempt with something that works. 

TJ - Aside from a more major focus on our presentation, we established my own and Daniel’s focus will be placed on the front-end of things and that Aaron and Sergio will have their focus on the back end of things. Got the most part, I’ve just been trying to organize everyone so that we all know what to be working on.
