### **1. Summary of activities**

Each member reports on their activities since the last meeting. Remember that coding activity is expected every week. 

**Aaron**: **I collected and composed an Excel file that holds all the professor ratings for the CS and CYB professors to start off our database for the project. I also spoke with Sergio in regard to the backend development, and we determined that we should use Python and Django to manage our data.** 

**Sergio**: **I have been testing possible ways to manage our data using python and C. Finding that using lists and dictionaries in python might be the best way to go since you dictionaries allow us to use the name of the class directly and display specific content from the list directly making it easier to display everything related to a class or just specific elements.**

**Daniel: Since we are changing the direction of how we are going to implement our project (creating a website), my goal for this week was to research where our website was going to be hosted and what frontend languages and technologies we would use for implementation. I have concluded that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be essential to both building our website and getting the scheduling feature. For the front-end framework, I think React.js will be the most optimal and will be well suited for handling mock data. It’ll be easy to create components that represent the schedule, and updating it will be simple. I have considered state management libraries like Redux or React Context to manage the data, but for our application, that may not be necessary. As far as where the website will be hosted, I was heavily considering using HostWinds.**

**TJ: With our project changing directions, I made a clickup for a list of basic tasks for our group to complete as we get into the coding phase. I also front headed many of our meetings this week to discuss revising the deliverable, planning for the presentation and getting everyone onto the same page. I also did some looking into hosting the website on which our system will reside.**


### **2. Project retrospective**

**Retrospective:** This week has been rough for most of the team members because of midterms and lots of work, so we have not really been able to contribute as much as we wanted to the current project.

1. Appreciations:

- **TJ created and organized a Clickup project to store all the project issues.**

2. Successes:

- **Have a clearer scope for our project.**
- **We have generally made more progress towards our actual product compared to our last idea.**

3. Failures:(what did not go well)

- **We had to fix some of our requirements from deliverable 2**
- **Need actual non-functional requirements**
- **More functional requirements**
- **More potential stakeholders.**

4. Barriers: 

- **Time constraints: it's the middle of the semester, and our team is juggling a lot on top of this.**
- **The team largely meeting through the duration of friday finishing a lot of work before TJ had planned to contribute**

5. What we should try next time: 

- **I think our communication overall among ourselves and the professor has room for improvement, so we are avoiding more crunch time.**

**Ideas Discussed:** 

- Fixing of previous deliverable answers

<!---->

- Format of presentation
- Allocation of man-hours
- Beginning team website 
- Collection of more data
- Determine what part of project should be in C


### **3. Next steps**

- Create midterm presentation (Team)
- Determine who does which part (Team)
- Practice presentation (Team)
- Create initial team website (TJ & Daniel)
- Upload more data to google drive sheet and create initial database (Sergio & Aaron)
