Project repo: https://github.com/UnlimitedDrip/ProjectPinecone
## 1. Summary of activities
Each member reports on their activities since the last meeting. Remember that coding activity is expected every week. 
## 2. Project retrospective
In each meeting, you should spend a few minutes discussing how the group is functioning. What aspects of the group dynamics contribute to the success of the project? In addition, raise any issues—best done directly but with humor and kindness—that you believe are interfering with the effectiveness of the group and your ability to complete the project on time.
The project retrospective is an opportunity for the group and each individual to reflect on their experience with the project and improve the way the group works together. Make at least five lists:

1.Appreciations: Everyone coordinated the meeting efficiently<br>
2.Successes: Everyone showed up, we all seem on same page<br>
3.Failures: We lost a teammate before our first meeting.<br>
4.Barriers: Adjust to smaller team size, one late teammate<br>
5.What we can do better: N/A<br>

If you don’t have anything to report in one of these lists, just state it.
A common practice among software teams is to use sticky notes (one color for each category), which each team member uses to write down their ideas for each category (one idea per sticky). As people post their stickies on the whiteboard, the facilitator should group similar or duplicate ideas together. This way the idea becomes decoupled from the person who introduced it. Discuss your ideas briefly as a team.

Make the retrospective an open and safe space for the team to reflect on and discuss what works well (and what doesn't!) so you can improve. Don't make it personal, and don't take it personally. Be open to criticism and offer constructive and polite critiques. Focus on how to improve the quality of your team and the product you are developing.
## 3. Next steps
Think about what needs to be done and assign tasks. Update your activity tracker with new tasks, actual hours spent in the activities, corresponding GitHub issues, and the status of the work.
# The First Meeting..
In this first meeting, you have many things to decide. The agenda should have at least the following items. In the meeting report, create a section for each item and summarize what has been discussed/decided:
1. Introductions: 
- Aaron: Senior, has taken a lot of classes, C, Web
- Daniel: Junior, transfer student, C, little python
- Sergio: Junior, C, worked on some outside projects, little python, Some web
- TJ: Junior, transfer student, some game development, C, java, python
2. Availability of the team members: 
- TJ: Free most days (preferred ont on mon, wed or sun) 
- Daniel: Free almost anytime, would rather not do weekends 
- Aaron: avoid weekends, free after 4 PM during weekdays
- Sergio: Thurs, fri, Sat, Sun, maybe monday, wednesday
3. Timeslot for the group meetings: 
- Todays Meeting: Saturday, 8pm
- Future Meetings: Friday, 4pm
4. Roles for each week:(manager, quality assurance, minute taker, and presenter),
- Daniel: minute taker 
- Aaron: manager
- TJ: presenter
- Sergio - quality assurance 

Define the schedule of the meetings: You should have weekly meetings starting in the 2nd week of classes until the week before the reading week (see the Course Schedule on Canvas). No meetings are required during the Spring break, if we have one. In total, you need to plan 13 meetings. For each meeting, define who will be responsible for each role. Remember, all decisions should be registered in the meeting minutes. 

***Review what we did in the past week, discuss issues we encountered, than discuss our plans for the next week.***<br>

Decision-making process: Discuss how you are going to deal with disagreements on design choices. E.g.: “We will make decisions by unanimous agreement" sounds nice, but a "2/3 majority" may be more helpful in moving things along. 

***75% majority for decision making***<br>
How to deal with non-performing team members: Now, it’s time for an uncomfortable topic that can save a lot of stress later on. Discuss and make agreements (to be also documented in the minutes) on at least the following issues:
***Clear communication and messaging if that doesnt work we will contact the professor***<br>

How will team members deal with a team member who appears to exercise too much control over the team?
***75% rule, 50% in event of third, especially complacent member***<br>

How will team members deal with a team member who does not appear to be shouldering their responsibilities within the project, or who is not contributing during team meetings?
***Set earlier “deadlines” to create buffer if assistance is needed***<br>

Please, establish the procedure of contacting the unmotivated member and the actions that will be taken. 
How will the team deal with members who show up late for meetings or miss them? 
***TJ will coordinate with any no-shows to keep them caught up, focus communication about all else and we should be able to figure it out***<br>

Coming to basic agreements about some of the most contentious issues of group work before these issues have surfaced provides a basis for discussing and dealing with them calmly. Putting these issues on the table as legitimate for group discussion also makes more explicit the co-responsibility that all group members have toward one another and helps to avoid some difficult situations.
If the team cannot internally solve problems related to the participation of a member (I hope it will not get to that point), we will adopt the same policy used for the capstone project:
https://www.cefns.nau.edu/~edo/Classes/CS_Capstone/Docs/Disciplinary_process.html
However, it is important to try to work out the problems inside the group first. You can also take a look at the following text:
https://www.cefns.nau.edu/~edo/Classes/CS_Capstone/Docs/Coping-With-Hitchhikers-and-Couch-Potatoes-on-Teams.pdf
Finally, remember that the actual contribution of each member toward each deliverable of the project should be reported (see the explanation about the deliverable format and submission on Canvas) and that peer evaluation has a significant impact in your grading. Please, don’t let your team down!
Project idea: Now it is time to discuss project ideas and scope. Read again the part of the Team Project Instructions document about the project idea and size. After deliberating in the group, add in the project minutes a short description of what your product is going to be and what the main proposed functionalities are. 

***Reduce the number of tabs needed to be open when registering for classes***
***-Rate my professor statistics, previous class data, etc.***
***-Class Requirements***
***-See your own Academic Progress***<br>

Some remarks about the project scope: I would like to remind you that the focus of our course is on software engineering techniques, so the project does not need to be technologically sophisticated (e.g., dealing with large volumes of data, adopting cutting-edge technology, etc.). You don’t want to spend most of your time trying to figure out how to accomplish the implementation itself or learning a new framework or programming language. Just manage the risks. The more important aspect of the project is that it must be valuable for someone. The most common choices for this course are mobile apps and web systems. I don’t want you to finish the course and say “hey, this is a proof of concept that shows that this technology works,” I prefer “hey, this is a prototype of a product that has value for someone and that is well-designed for future evolution.” Of course, it is very hard to come up with an idea for a helpful product out of the blue. Don’t worry, you can change your mind or pivot over the semester. We will have classes to discuss how to determine if your idea is worth pursuing. 

***Browser: Firefox (& Chrome if in scale)***
***Product: Web Extension for Louie***
***Objectives:***
***-Retrieve information directly from louie, rate my professor***
***-Togglable features that can be turned off in case of privacy concerns***
***-Ability to operate without storing data***
***-If browser extension has too many limitations, may instead be standalone program***

Project name: You need a short name to refer to your project. You will use this name, for example, to create the project infrastructure. 
***Project Pinecone***<br>

Technologies: What do you propose to use in terms of technologies for developing the project? No strings attached. You can change later on, but it is worth deciding about the initial infrastructure. Think about programming and scripting languages, database technologies, frameworks, libraries, protocols, GUI, running platforms, development environment, remote services, etc.
***Languages: C(++), HTML,JavaScript, CSS, Docker?***<br>

Add a paragraph about how your team is planning to learn/internally disseminate knowledge about the technologies.
***Split projects into smaller pieces, assign them with specific “deadlines” and people, sharing useful resources along the way. We are going to assign different topics for each team member to research and will report back to the team on monday so we can decide what to move forward with. Weigh the pros and cons of each technology and figure out what would work best for our needs.***<br>

Collaboration tools: Now it is time to prepare the infrastructure for the project. First, check if everyone in the group has self-enrolled in the group on Canvas (putting the name on the shared spreadsheet is not enough).
***Discord, Github, more as needed?***<br>

GitHub: Create a project on GitHub and add the team members to the repository. If someone does not have a GitHub account, this is a good time to create one. Create a folder named “Deliverables” on the GitHub repository, so you can later add the project deliverables there.
Communication tool: Choose a synchronous communication tool to keep in touch with your teammates. Common choices are Slack (https://slack.com/), Discord, and MS Teams. Add all the group members to the communication tool (the instructors do not need to be added). I recommend installing the communication tool app on your mobile device so you can receive notifications.
***Discord, Github***<br>

In the minutes, report the address of the GitHub repository and what other tool(s) you will be using for your project.

Next steps: Now it is time to plan the next steps (who/what/when). Create a copy of the following spreadsheet and share it with the members of the group. This spreadsheet should be updated every week. Delete the example data and fill it in with your planning.
