# **Report for Week 2 Meeting**
**Group 6:** Project Pinecone
**Date and location:** 9/15/23, Discord
**Present participants:** (Quality Assurance: Aaron Santiago), (Presenter: Daniel Minichetti),(Manager: Sergio Rabadan), (TJ: Minute Taker)
**Missing participants:** N/A
**Project repo:** https://github.com/UnlimitedDrip/ProjectPinecone
## **1. Summary of activities**
**Aaron:** I made an extension that creates a red border around a website. It was very basic, and I followed a Mozilla Firefox rubric and learned a lot about creating an extension.<br>
**Sergio:** I worked on a basic extension that displays the time in Flagstaff in real time, and realized that making an extension is very similar to making a website. A manifest is used as the structure that calls the other files and kind of organizes them together to make the extension working.<br>
**Daniel:** I worked on two basic extensions using the Mozilla documentation, learned the basics of file structure and how all the parts of an extension work. <br>
**TJ:** I worked on researching extension basics.<br>
